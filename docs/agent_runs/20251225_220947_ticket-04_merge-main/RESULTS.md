# Results

- Confirmed AGENTS policy now permits merges to `main` on explicit user instruction; user stated they made this change, and AGENTS.md reflects the exception.
- Fast-forward merged `codex/ticket-04-leakage-tests-unsafe-manifest` into `main` and pushed to origin.
- Added merge run log and PROGRESS update documenting the user policy change note and merge.
- After committing the merge run log on the feature branch, fast-forwarded `main` again to include the log commit and pushed `main` and the feature branch.
