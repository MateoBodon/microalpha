# Microalpha

Microalpha is an event-driven research platform for reproducible quantitative strategy development. The engine prioritises leakage-safety, deterministic execution, and rich analytics so researchers can iterate quickly without sacrificing rigor.

## Why Microalpha?

- **Leakage-safe core**: strict timestamp ordering, FIFO broker interactions, and lookahead guards.
- **Execution realism**: TWAP/impact models and a configurable level-2 limit order book.
- **Reproducible pipelines**: manifest metadata, trade logs, and automation-ready CLI.
- **Extensible design**: users can plug in new strategies, data handlers, and execution layers.
- **Documentation-first**: MkDocs site with invariants, manifests, API references, and runnable demos.

Use the navigation to dive into leakage guarantees, reproducibility tooling, API surfaces, and runnable examples.
