"go ahead and do these   1. Add diagnostics to count symbols surviving each filter (universe, min_price, min_adv, sector caps) per fold.
  2. Inspect the universe file at $WRDS_DATA_ROOT/universes/flagship_sector_neutral.csv for coverage issues (missing symbols/sectors).
  3. Run a single‑fold debug WFV with relaxed logging only (no parameter changes) to locate the zero‑signal stage."
