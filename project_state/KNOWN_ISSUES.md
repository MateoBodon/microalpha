# Known Issues

- WRDS runs require local exports and are blocked without `WRDS_DATA_ROOT` (see `docs/wrds.md`).
- Large data directories (`data/`, `data_sp500/`, `data_sp500_enriched/`) are present; avoid deep parsing in automation.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-01: Tightened WRDS caps + smoke targets + report upgrades (Status: Partial — blocked by missing WRDS exports). Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251220_223500_ticket-01_wrds-tighten-caps/`.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-02: Holdout evaluation mode added for walk-forward validation (Status: FAIL (review) — bundle lacked holdout evidence + DIFF mismatch). Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251221_154039_ticket-02_holdout-wfv/`.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-02: Full WRDS holdout WFV run completed (Status: Done; zero-trade output flagged). Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251221_173223_ticket-02_holdout-wfv-wrds-full/`.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-02: WRDS report run failed at SPA step (Status: Blocked; zero SPA comparator t-stats). Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251221_175417_ticket-02_holdout-wfv-wrds-report/`. Artifacts: `artifacts/wrds_flagship/2025-12-21T22-32-44Z-2b48ef7/`.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-12: PnL integrity checks + same-day fill equity refresh + diagnostic tooling; sample WFV rerun and report generated. WRDS smoke rerun + report completed under `$WRDS_DATA_ROOT` (`artifacts/wrds_flagship_smoke/2025-12-23T20-19-56Z-7ca855f/`), integrity diagnostics OK. WRDS flagship rerun completed (`artifacts/wrds_flagship/2025-12-23T19-40-24Z-ff2979d/`); run remains degenerate (zero trades). Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251223_080000_ticket-12_fix-wrds-pnl-integrity/`.
- From `PROGRESS.md`: Ticket-13: Non-degenerate WFV selection constraints added; WRDS flagship degeneracy now fails fast when constraints are enabled. A real-data rerun under `$WRDS_DATA_ROOT` is still required to confirm non-degenerate trades. Run log: `docs/agent_runs/20251226_023453_ticket-13_fix-wrds-degeneracy/`.
