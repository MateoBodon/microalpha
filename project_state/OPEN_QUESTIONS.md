# Open Questions

- Full WRDS walk-forward rerun with tightened caps is pending (see `docs/results_wrds.md`).
- Confirm which WRDS export schema is authoritative if additional columns are needed beyond `docs/wrds.md`.
- Decide whether to keep `Plan.md` as long-term roadmap or split into `docs/plan.md` (per `Plan.md`).
- Do we need additional public datasets beyond `data/public/` for regression tests?
